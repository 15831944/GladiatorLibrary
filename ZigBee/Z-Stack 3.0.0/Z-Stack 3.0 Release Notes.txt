Z-Stack 3.0.0 Release Notes

Version 3.0.0
Nov 30, 2016

Notices:

 Z-Stack 3.0.0 meet the requirements for full conformance to ZigBee 3.0, including Base Device Behaviour 1.0, GreenPower Basic Proxy, and ZCL 6. The Z-Stack 3.0.0 release is based on Z-Stack Core 2.7.0 - see the "Z-Stack Core Release Notes" for details.

 The sample application user interface is described in details in the header comment in the following files: The common interface is described in Projects\zstack\HomeAutomation\Source\zcl_sampleapps_ui.c and each application's specific interface is described in the respective files: Projects\zstack\HomeAutomation\Sample###\Source\zcl_Sample###.c 
 
 Z-Stack projects specify compile options in two ways: (1) "-D" statements in f8wConfig.cfg and other *.cfg files, (2) entries in the IDE Compiler Preprocessor Defined Symbols. When using the EW8051 compiler, settings made in the IDE will override settings in the *.cfg files. When using the EWARM compiler, settings in the *.cfg files will override any made in the IDE.  

 When programming devices for the first time with this release, the entire Flash memory should be erased. For the CC2530/1 platforms, select "Erase Flash" in the "Debugger->Texas Instruments->Download" tab of the project options. For the CC2538, select "Project->Download->Erase Memory".

 Application, library, and hex files were built/tested with the following versions of IAR tools and may not work with different IAR tool versions:   - CC2538 + SRF06EB:  EWARM  7.70.1  (7.70.1.11486)   - CC2530 + SRF05EB:  EW8051 9.30.1 (9.30.1)
	 
 Foundation software library files for the CC2538 include the following:
 - bsp.lib, version 1.3.1
 - driverlib.lib, version 1.3.1
 - usblib.lib, version 1.0.1
 
 Test for BDB conformance was done with ZTT 1.0.10 using a related sample application to validate the features tested in BDB test spec (14-0439-22)
 
 Serial Bootloader and OTA functionalities were tested
 
 ZNP projects were tested to be backward compatible with previous versions of Linux gateway device and to support Z3.0 MT interface and commands
 
 ZDApp states supported: DEV_HOLD, DEV_INIT, DEV_END_DEVICE, DEV_ROUTER, DEV_ZB_COORD and DEV_NWK_ORPHAN. ZDApp may notify other states that may not be accurate. User should only use supported states or rely on BDB notifications by registering the proper callbacks (commissioning, bindings, identify notifications)
 
 TouchLink were tested only for SampleLight (TL Target) and SampleSwitch (TL Initiator) applications.

Optimizations:
 - F&B procedure if call with FINDING_AND_BINDING_PERIODIC_ENABLE to true, will keep track of those devices that did respond to identify query and already have responded to simple descriptor to not repeat the process during this procedure call.

 - TrustCenterLinkKey manager got updated to reduce the size of the structures stored in Nv to manage the security material for the joining devices.

 - BDB has implemented an increased poll rate during the joining of a Centralized security network, to allow the ZED perform this process as fast as possible avoiding get kicked-out of the network if TCLK exchange procedure is mandated for TC device.
 
Bug Fixes:
 - Fixed a problem in which router device 'A' that looks for a device 'B' while other device 'C' in the network is looking for the same device 'B', blocked 'A' searching mechanism for 'B'.
 
 - Fixed a problem with NV initialization for AddrMgr Table, Binding Table, APS LinkKey Table and APS Group Table, in which, if the voltage level during the initialization of the device is near the threshold VDD_MIN_NV, those tables were erased.

 - Fixed a bug in CC2538 devices for NV items ZCD_NV_NWKKEY, ZCD_NV_NWK_ACTIVE_KEY_INFO, ZCD_NV_NWK_ALTERN_KEY_INFO in which those NV items were not being read properly after flashing a new image to the CC2538 target device.

Notes:

 - During F&B with more than one device, the discovery process of the F&B (broadcast of IdentifyQuery and reception of IdentifyQueryRsp) may initially fail for some of the devices. The process is automatically retried by the stack every 15 seconds during 180 seconds, to make sure all the required devices can be found. This behaviour is controlled by the macro FINDING_AND_BINDING_PERIODIC_ENABLE.

 - ZNP devices do not support GP Commissioning for GPD that request to change channel to perform bidirectional commissioning
 
 - To perform FN reset via MT interface, both ZCD_STARTOPT_DEFAULT_CONFIG_STATE and ZCD_STARTOPT_DEFAULT_NETWORK_STATE must be set when writing to NV start-up options.
 
 - In big networks, it is recommended to all joining and rejoining process have a random jitter that needs to be tuned accordingly to the size of the network and the distribution of the nodes, to allow the joining process to be performed correctly
