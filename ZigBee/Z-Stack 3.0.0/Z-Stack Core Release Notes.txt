Version 2.7.0
May 13, 2016

Notices:
 - Z-Stack 2.7.0 has been certified as a ZigBee Compliant Platform (ZCP)

Updates:

Distributed networks:
 - NLME_NetworkFormationRequest updated for distributed networks. Router devices can create its own network
   with distributed security. Only one APS key is needed, which is used to deliver the nwk key and is known 
   to all devices. This APS key cannot be updated neither the nwk key. No support for APS security between 
   devices.
  
Child management:
 - Timeout agreement between ZED and parent device to expire ZED if no keep-alive message is receive by parent.
   Orphan notification mechanism as keep-alive message has been removed and only MAC poll is supported. Default 
   timeout is configured in parents for legacy devices that do not perform the agreement upon joining.
   Expired devices will get a nwk Leave request with rejoin=1.
   
Nwk Leave and ZDO Mgmt Leave:   
 - Nwk_Leave and ZDO Mgmt_Leave processing changed to: ZC shall ignore, ZR accept 
   from anyone, ZED accept only from parent. Leave with rejoin 0 causes reset and erase 
   all persistent data except for nwkFrameCounter (reset to factory new).
 
Nwk Frame Counter:
 - Persistent across resets, Factory new resets, across different nwk. Restarted only if 
   network key is updated and it was greater than 0x80000000
 - Multiple network frame counter instances can be used across different network by setting
   MAX_NWK_SEC_MATERIAL_TABLE_ENTRIES

Permit Joining:
 - Permit duration [0xFF] is process as [0xFE]. TC_significance always set and considerate as 1

Stack compliance version:
 - Node descriptor response now reflects the current stack compliance version
  
Centralized Network Updates:
 - Security Services and policies added/updated:
	- Added APS Verify Key: ZR/ZED command to verify its unique link key with the TrustCenter
	- Added APS Confirm Key: TrustCenter command to confirm the unique key used by ZR/ZED with TrustCenter
    - Added AllowRejoin policy
 - Joining devices must check TrustCenter stack revision. If this revision is R21 or later, they must 
   update its APS key with the TrustCenter. This APS key will be used for all APS commands between the 
   TrustCenter and the Joining Device. APS commands secured with APS key has extended nonce
 - Support for Install Codes and allowInstallCodes policy


Bug Fixes:
 - Fix maximum payload size before a fragmentation to be 127 bytes
