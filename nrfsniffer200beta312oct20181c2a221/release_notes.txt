Version 2.0.0-beta-3:

Bugfix release to fix the the sniffing for DLE and 2Mbit PHY
    - Bugfix for Data Length Update procedure and 2Mbit PHY (PCA10040 only, requires Wireshark version 2.4.6 or
      newer)

Version 2.0.0-beta-2:

Summary:
This release updates to use version 2 of the sniffer UART protocol which supports UART packets
larger than 256 bytes.

New features:
    - Support for v2 of sniffer UART protocol. SnifferAPI supports firmware v1 sniffer UART
      protocol.
    - Support for Data Length Update procedure (PCA10040 only, requires Wireshark version 2.4.6 or
      newer)

Bug fixes:
    - Improved UART stability.

Version 2.0.0-b1:

Summary:
This release replaces the old nRF Sniffer.exe control window used for sending
commands to the sniffer hardware. This functionality is now moved to Wireshark.

As a result of this, nrf_sniffer now supports all platforms supported by
Wireshark (Windows, Linux, OSX).

The supported hardware has also been updated to PCA10028, PCA10031 and PCA10040.
Note that PCA10040 uses nRF52 while the others uses nRF51.

Deprecated features:
    - nRF_Sniffer.exe application (replaced with support in Wireshark)

New features:
    - Support for nRF52 (PCA10040).
    - Support for 2mbit mode (PCA10040 only, Requires Wireshark version 2.4.2 or newer).

Known issues:
    - Several lost packets is reported when starting the sniffer.
